# Plotting
I wanted to plot a simple graph of the number of carcasses of each species that I had from the past summer of fieldwork. 
I used the package ggplot2 for this.

```{r}
ggplot(Video_metadata, aes(x=Species, fill = Species))+
  geom_bar()+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

This was a very simple graph. I used a barplot with each species having a different color. Because we already have labels on the axes, I removed the legend. Theme black and white looked nice with this simple design.
