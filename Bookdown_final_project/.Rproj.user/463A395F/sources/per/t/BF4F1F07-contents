# Intro - Database Structure

This chapter describes the process of designing and building my database.

## Designing the Database

The first summer's data was already collected. Data was sorted 
into 4 tables. 
The first table is Condor_individuals, which holds information 
on each condor and its characteristics, such as sex and birth 
date. The second table is Carcasses, which stores carcass 
information such as when I put out each carcass, carcass 
weight, and habitat information on each carcass location. The 
third table, Video_metadata, includes data that helped me to 
organize during the field season and afterwards when looking at
videos, such as the video id number, name of the SD card that 
the video is on, and carcass descriptions. The fourth excel sheet is names Visits. It holds all observations of visits by any scavenger, and information pertaining to that visit, such as duration of visit, weather condition at arrival, and times spent doing different activities, such as feeding time.

### An unnumbered section {-}

Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a `{.unnumbered}` or the shorter `{-}` at the end of the heading, like in this section.
